This document outlines how FSIPS extends daily session generation into longer-term periodization, borrowing explicitly from strength-training mesocycles.

## 1. Rationale

Unbounded daily progression leads to:
- tendon overuse
- CNS fatigue
- skill plateaus

FSIPS therefore supports explicit mesocycle structure.

## 2. Mesocycle Phases

### Accumulation

- Volume increases
- Overload applied primarily via duration and density
- F1 dominant, limited F2

### Intensification

- Volume stabilizes or decreases
- Overload applied via tempo, complexity, or constraints
- Selective F2 exposure

### Deload

- Volume reduced
- F2 eliminated
- Focus on precision and recovery

## 3. Typical Mesocycle Length

- 3–5 weeks accumulation
- 1–2 weeks intensification
- 1 week deload

Lengths are adjustable.

## 4. Generator Interaction

Session type input influences:
- fatigue caps
- overload ceilings
- exercise selection bias

Deload sessions:
- cap fatigue at F1
- bias toward F0 exercises
- suppress progression

## 5. Transition Criteria

Mesocycle transitions may be triggered by:
- calendar duration
- rising failure rates
- user request

Transitions are explicit, not implicit.
