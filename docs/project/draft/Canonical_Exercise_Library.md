# FSIPS — Canonical Exercise Library

**Version:** 0.1

> **Nomenclature Note:** This document uses the original project name "FSIPS" (Fretted String Instrument Practice System). The project has since been renamed to **MNEMOSYS**. This historical document is preserved in draft form pending revision to reflect current terminology.

This document is a supplemental reference to the FSIPS v0.1 architecture overview. It enumerates the canonical (foundational) exercises identified so far.

A canonical exercise represents a conceptual training primitive. Variants (tempo, rhythm, range, constraints, etc.) are produced via overload dimensions and are not separate exercises.

Total target size: ~35 exercises. This list is intentionally compact and designed to remain stable as variants expand.

## I. Technique — Mechanical Primitives

### T1. Four-Finger Chromatic Independence

Chromatic patterns emphasizing fretting-hand finger independence.

### T2. Right-Hand Fingerstyle Consistency

Even alternation, endurance, and dynamic control of the plucking/picking hand.

### T3. String Crossing Control

Clean transitions between adjacent strings using controlled hand motion.

### T4. String Skipping

Intentional skipping of intermediate strings with clean articulation.

### T5. Legato Mechanics

Hammer-ons, pull-offs, trills, and sustained legato control.

### T6. Barring & Finger Collapse Control

Preventing unintended string contact and managing partial barring.

### T7. Slap / Pop / Tap Coordination

Percussive and hybrid techniques requiring precise coordination.

### T8. Raking / Economy Motion Control

Controlled directional picking or plucking across strings.

### T9. Cross-String Fingerpicking

Alternating patterns emphasizing adjacent-string interaction.

## II. Pitch & Harmony Systems

### H1. Modal Scale Navigation

Navigation of modal scales across the fretboard.

### H2. Harmonic Minor System

Harmonic minor scale and its modal derivatives.

### H3. Melodic Minor System

Melodic minor scale and its modal derivatives.

### H4. Non-Modal / Symmetric Scales

Diminished, whole-tone, and other symmetric or exotic scales.

### H5. Pentatonic System

Pentatonic scales across positions and string sets.

### H6. Chromatic Scale Control

Chromatic motion for fretboard fluency and control.

## III. Arpeggios & Chord-Tone Work

### A1. Triad Arpeggios

Major, minor, and diminished triads across inversions and strings.

### A2. Seventh-Chord Arpeggios

Maj7, min7, dominant, and related seventh chords.

### A3. Voice-Led Arpeggios

Arpeggios emphasizing minimal movement between chord tones.

### A4. Arpeggio–Scale Hybrid Patterns

Overlaying arpeggios with related scales.

### A5. Ornamented Chord-Tone Patterns

Approach tones and change-tone logic applied to chord tones.

## IV. Pattern Systems (Abstract)

### P1. Numeric Permutation Patterns

Ordered permutations of scale degrees.

### P2. Disjunct & Non-Adjacent Patterns

Patterns emphasizing intervallic skips.

### P3. Grouping-Based Patterns

Note groupings such as 3s, 5s, 6s, etc.

### P4. Boxed vs Shifting Pattern Control

Managing hand position constraints versus shifting patterns.

### P5. Composite Pattern Layering

Combining multiple pattern logics simultaneously.

## V. Rhythm & Time Systems

### R1. Subdivision Cycling

Systematic cycling through rhythmic subdivisions.

### R2. Altered Rhythm Practice

Long–short and imbalance rhythm permutations.

### R3. Accent Displacement

Shifting accents across steady subdivisions.

### R4. Polymetric Practice

Conflicting rhythmic groupings against a steady pulse.

### R5. Metronome Reinterpretation

Re-mapping the click to different perceived beats.

### R6. Metric Modulation

Reinterpreting rhythmic units as a new pulse.

## VI. Musicianship & Application

### M1. Constrained Improvisation

Improvisation under explicit positional, rhythmic, or technical constraints.

### M2. Transcription

Learning musical material by ear.

### M3. Repertoire Refinement

Focused work on specific song sections or passages.

### M4. Ear Training

Interval, chord, and harmonic recognition exercises.

### M5. Fretboard Mapping

Explicit identification and traversal of pitch locations.

## Notes

- Exercises are intentionally instrument-agnostic.
- Difficulty is introduced via overload dimensions, not exercise duplication.
- This list is expected to remain stable; growth occurs through variants.
