# MNEMOSYS Standards and Conventions

This document captures coding standards, naming conventions, and architectural patterns for the MNEMOSYS project. These conventions ensure consistency, maintainability, and alignment with the project's core principles.

## Database Conventions

### Table Naming Convention

**Rule**: Database table names are **singular**, not plural.

**Rationale**: A table name expresses what is represented by a single row, not a collection. A row in the `instrument` table represents one instrument, not multiple instruments.

**Examples**:
- ✅ `instrument` (not `instruments`)
- ✅ `exercise` (not `exercises`)
- ✅ `session` (not `sessions`)
- ✅ `session_block` (not `session_blocks`)
- ✅ `block_log` (not `block_logs`)
- ✅ `exercise_state` (already singular)

**Implementation**: Use `__tablename__` attribute in SQLAlchemy ORM models:
```python
class Instrument(Base):
    __tablename__ = "instrument"
    # ...
```

## To Be Organized

Additional standards and conventions will be collected here as the project evolves. This section serves as a staging area before formal organization.
